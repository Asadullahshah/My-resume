            <p>National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences</p>
            <p>Sep 2021 - Prensent (1 year 10 months)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>My passion for technology drove me to pursue CS.</li>

                    While studying here, I have worked on various projects both solo and as a group. Such as:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Created a student portal using Blazor web framework, SSMS, and ASP.NET.</li>
                        <li>Created a basic neural network while implementing the concepts of OS:
                        Each layer was implemented as a new process using fork() and each neuron as
                        a thread and for the layers to communicate with each other, pipes were
                        used. Moreover, a scheduler, in our case a basic queue, was used to ensure
                        correct forward and backpropagation.
